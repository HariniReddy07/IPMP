# Incident & Problem Management Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing incident trends, monitoring RCA backlog, and tracking incident recurrence using Power BI/Tableau dashboards. The goal is to optimize resolution timelines and provide real-time insights to stakeholders.

## Project Components
1. **Incident Data (CSV)**: Contains sample incident records with categories, priority levels, RCA completion status, and resolution times.
2. **Dashboard (Power BI / Tableau)**: Interactive visualizations for monitoring RCA backlog and incident recurrence.
3. **Python Data Processing**: Scripts to clean and preprocess incident data.
4. **Reports**: Insights from dashboards for data-driven decision-making.

## Dashboard Features
- **RCA Backlog Tracking**: Monitor pending and completed RCAs.
- **Incident Recurrence Metrics**: Analyze how often incidents reoccur.
- **Resolution Time Analysis**: Track and optimize Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR).
- **Stakeholder Reporting**: Provide actionable insights for process improvement.

## How to Use
1. Load the `incident_data.csv` file into Power BI or Tableau.
2. Use provided Python scripts to preprocess data before visualization.
3. Analyze insights from the dashboard to improve incident resolution efficiency.
